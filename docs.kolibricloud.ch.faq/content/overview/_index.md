# Frequently Asked Questions

Here some common questions to the KELLER KOLIBRI Cloud. If you miss a question/answer please contact <kolibri@keller-druck.ch> or write a new issue on Github (https://github.com/KELLERAGfuerDruckmesstechnik/Kolibri-Cloud-Documentation).


##What does "cloud", "IoT", "LoRa" mean?
IoT ("Internet of Things"): Hype term that describes a system / network of things (= devices) with sensors , which perform well together or with users thanks to information exchange (e.g. measurement data through the Internet).
KELLER has been using IoT devices for many years: GSM data loggers and now also LoRa devices.
Cloud . Can be defined as follows: By " cloud  computing" one can mean storing and accessing data and programs via the Internet or the opposite is saving data to your hard disk. The term "cloud" is also used as a metaphor for "the Internet".
LoRa (long range): Long range, low power wireless platform. A popular IoT wireless protocol. Similar to GSM, measurement data from the KELLER sensor can be sent away wirelessly to the next antenna/gateway, and from there forwarded via the Internet to FTP / mail servers or even LoRa servers. LoRa has the advantages over GSM that it is cheaper and requires less power (smaller, cheaper battery)

##What kind of IoT devices does KELLER have?
KELLER sells pressure sensors that send data via GSM or LoRa. Both using the ARC-1 variations. With or without ATEX certification. 
In 2019 KELLER will sell cost-efficient LoRa-devices. And there will be the first NB-IoT prototypes, too.

##Can I use other non-KELLER devices?
Yes, as long as you use KELLER pressure sensors you can use other sending devices.
E.g. [DecentLab](https://www.decentlab.com/products/)


##What does "KOLIBRI" even mean?
KOLIBRI is the name of the new KELLER AG product line. Its the German name for Hummingbird starting with a K as in KELLER.
Currently this product line contains:
 - KOLIBRI Cloud : Web portal for customers to access data
 - KOLIBRI Desktop : The new logger software application that we use to store and visualise data from data loggers on the Windows PC.
 - KOLIBRI Mobile : The new Android app, with which you can load measurement data from KELLER data loggers via Bluetooth to a smartphone.
These products all use the latest technologies and a customized design. In addition, you will download and upload data from "KOLIBRI Desktop" and "KOLIBRI Mobile" to the "KOLIBRI Cloud".

##What is the "KOLIBRI Cloud"?
KOLIBRI is the name of the new KELLER AG product line.
Part of this new product line are the cloud possibilities, which are:
 - WebApp : The "Online Program" at www.kolibricloud.com
 - API : A standardized interface to transfer data (e.g. measurement data) in a common internet format to other programs/services/clouds
 - Documentations : How to interpret the measurement data of GSM / LoRa devices? How does the API work? All protocols and simple examples should be openly documented.
 - Tools : To simplify the integration of our IoT devices, sample programs and libraries are available for free or even open sourced.

##What is the roadmap of the features?
See ...todo link

##The customer wants to create his own web app or mobile app. How can KELLER help the customer?
Customer may use our WebApp to see that their devices are sending data (proof-of-concept). This means that he can IMMEDIATELY start testing our devices in his environment.
Then he can use our API to make data queries. He now has to develop an User Interface and address our API. We help him with sample programs and good documentation.

##The customer does not want to use our "cloud". (ie the customer wants to save and present the data by himself). How can KELLER help the customer?
Customer may use our WebApp to see that their devices are sending data (proof-of-concept). This means that he can IMMEDIATELY start testing our devices in his environment.
During the testing phase, he can start using our documentation to integrate his devices into his solution.
