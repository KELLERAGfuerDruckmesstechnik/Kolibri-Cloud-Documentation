If you want to try out the API with [Swagger](https://api.kolibricloud.ch/swagger/index.html?url=/swagger/v1/swagger.json) please us the dark green [Authorize] button and a valid bearer token.  
![BearerToken From Swagger UI](../img/BearerTokenFromSwaggerUI.png)

You can get a valid bearer token when logged in on <http://www.kolibricloud.ch> under [User Settings]  
![BearerToken From Web App](../img/BearerTokenFromWebApp.png)

The `deviceId` are the same numbers that can be seen in the URL of the WebApp when the device is selected: [https://www.kolibricloud.ch/devices/**1234**/](https://www.kolibricloud.ch/devices/1234/)

If you want a *Permanent Access Token*, please contact the KOLIBRI support team (<kolibri@keller-druck.com>).
The provided access token must be the value with the key "userOid" in the header of every request. This way a bearer token and the OAUTH flow is NOT needed anymore.
