--------|-------- 
 ```GET /v1/Devices```      | Gets information of all devices 
 ```GET /v1/Devices/{deviceId}```     | Gets information of a specific device  
 ```GET /v1/Measurements``` | Gets a list of measurements composed of a value and a UTC datetime  
 ```GET /v1/PageSettings``` | Gets information about settings of the tenant group but also about **MeasurementDefinitionIds** and there alternative names  

##### Notes:  
DateTime format from the API are always in **UTC**  
Pressure values from the API are always in **bar**  
Temperature values from the API are always in **Â°C**  
It is not possible to delete measurement data with the API

If you plan run this as a server script to store measurement data from the KOLIBRI Cloud API the following procedure is recommended:  
 - Decide for a time span to gather date: eg. Every 24h  
 - Create a list of the ```deviceId```s that needs to be monitored (eg. ```my_devices=[1234,1235,1236]```)  
 - Create a list of ***MeasurementsDefinitonId***'s representing the physical measurement channel (eg. ```channels_of_interest=[2,5,7,8,11]```)  
 - Run the program every ~24h and  
   : - for all devices of interest...  
   : - for all channels of interest..  
   : - use ```get_data_measurements_from_timespan()``` with he timespan of ~24  
   : - and store the data into a DB  
   : - you might check first if the measurement(value+timestamp) is not already stored  
 - It is possible that a request fails. To solve this error case please re-call the data later again. You might gather data from an overlapped time slot and exclude measurements that has been stored already.
