# Features and Release History

## Releases

### v.1.19108.01

#### Translations Update

The most used languages for the KOLIBRI Cloud (DE, EN, FI and NL) got updated and verified by nativ speakers.

#### Mail Import

In addition to FTP import, Mail import over SMTP can be used as well.

#### Calculations

We added the possibility to define additional Calculations to the already existing ones (Water and Tank Calculations). These new Calculations support all the Water Calculations for now.

To enable it, head to _Page Settings_ and scroll down to _Profile_:

The Calculations get shown in the Device-Detail at the top of the chart and can be modified the same way Water or Tank Calculations are modified:
