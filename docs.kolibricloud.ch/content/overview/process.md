# General process and check list


  ◻ Communicate application and use cases to 'KELLER sales person'  

  ◻ Decide which sending technology works the best for the use case:
    LoRaWAN  vs  3G/4G  vs  NB-IoT/LTE-M  

  ◻ With cellular technology such as 3G/4G or NB-IoT/LTE-M:  
  - Know your coverage with maps such as https://www.gsma.com/coverage (4G/LTE) and https://www.gsma.com/iot/deployment-map (NB-IoT/LTE-M)  
  - Your mobile provider might show you a more recent coverage map  
  - For a temporary storage between KELLER sending devices and KOLIBRI cloud an FTP account is needed. By default, you have to use an own FTP host by yourself. Exceptionally, KELLER can offer to host an FTP account but can not guarantee 100% accessibility  
  - Consider using an IoT SIM card such as one from 1nce.com (Check if your county is supported using a coverage map and https://1nce.com/en/coverage)  

  ◻ With LoRaWAN technology:  
  - It is needed to have an own LoRaWAN infrastructure such as a 'LoRaWAN gateway' (or LoRaWAN compatible antenna from a mobile communication provider) and access to a 'LoRa Network Server' (eg. 'TheThingsNetwork', 'Loriot.io' or 'ThingPark/Actility'-portal from a mobile communication provider)  

  ◻ Decide together with sales person which sensor/probe(s), cable length and remote sending device (ARC1 vs. ADT1) and its housing (Tube vs. Box vs. Box SB) is needed (See datasheets)  
  ◻ Choose either ARC-1 or ADT-1  
  ◻ Choose an appropriate housing: Tube, Box or Box SB  
  ◻ Choose sensor / level probe depending on use case  
  ◻ Decide together with sales person which additional accessories are needed (See datasheets)  
- ARC1  
   - K-114 A Interface converter  
   - Monitoring pipe cap lock  
   - Monitoring pipe adapter ring  
- ADT1
   - Micro USB cable  
   - Monitoring pipe cap lock  
   - Monitoring pipe adapter ring  
  
◻ Try out www.kolibricloud.ch and visits the documentation page https://docs.kolibricloud.ch  
 ◻ Understand the benefits, the features and limitations of the 'KOLIBRI Cloud' 
 ◻ Even if an external cloud solution like the 'KOLIBRI Cloud' does not fit the use case it might be a good idea to start with it to test the connectivity and verify the data transfer  
◻ Read and understand the 'Terms and Conditions' for the KOLIBRI Cloud EN / DE  

◻ Decide if 'KOLIBRI Support team' shall pre-configure and connect the device to the KOLIBRI Cloud  
◻ If yes: Give the order to 'KELLER sales person'  
◻ Finalize order with sales person  

◻ When using cellular sending technology SIM-cards are needed. Due to legalreasons the customer has to buy the SIM cards  

◻ When the devices have to be pre-configured and the SIM-cards do work in Switzerland (such as IoT SIM cards from https://1nce.com), please send them toyour 'KELLER sales person'. The SIM card/s will be inserted into the device/sand used for the configuration.  

◻ Sign-Up on www.kolibricloud.ch with a username and E-Mail address.  
◻ Other users can also sign up and access the same measurement data if wished  
◻ Use the username to login  
◻ When forgetting the password the user can reset the password on wwwkolibricloud.ch  

◻ When the 'KOLIBRI Cloud API' has to be used to gather data to store them to acustomer specific SCADA/DB then see https://docs.kolibricloud.chcloud-interfaces/api/  

◻ When customer decides not to use the 'KOLIBRI Cloud' anymore and implement anown integration: See https://docs.kolibricloud.ch/cloud-interfacesiot-converter/  

◻ When it is needed to change or replace devices / delete or manipulate data?Ask 'KOLIBRI Support Team' (kolibri@keller-druck.com)
