# Status

ðŸŸ¢ ***OK*** - The KOLIBRI Cloud is working as planned

## Planned Maintenance windows

- None

## Outages & Maintenance Windows

---


### From 23.Jan.2020 to 10.Feb.2020

**Summary of Impact**:  
The "LastMeasurements" and the "DeviceInformation" showed older measurements (timestamp + values) then available and stored.  

**Preliminary Root Cause**:
The DevOps Engineer determined an error in a wrong continuous deployment process that upgraded only parts of the system causing the ```/v1/LastMeasurements``` endpoint to show an older measurement. Nevertheless, no data was lost and the ```/v1/Measurements``` endpoint continued to work properly.

**Mitigation:**:  
Engineers fixed and tested the issue.

**Next Steps**:  
None.

### 06.Nov.2019 from 16:00-17:00 CET

**Planned Maintenance Window**:  
Updated various features including test version of the new "Device Configuration" feature.  
Known issues:

- The Device Configuration-Button is hidden on purpose.
- "Measure interval" and "Next expected transmission" are showing wrong values due to missing device configurations

### 29.Okt.2019 from 17:00-21:00 CET

**Summary of Impact**:  
The storing of LoRa messages from TTN and Loriot.io was temporary impossible. LoRa from Actility networks were stored.

**Preliminary Root Cause**:
Engineers determined that an error in a recent deployment of a new auto-assignment feature to the backend of the KOLIBRI Cloud caused a conflict with specific LoRa-server protocol implementation.

**Mitigation:**:  
Engineers fixed and tested the protocol issue.

**Next Steps**:  
Customers who lost important data can contact the KOLIBRI Cloud support (kolibri@keller-druck.com) to retrieve the missing measurement data from the log files.

### 2.May.2019 from 20:00-22:00 UTC

**Summary of Impact**:  
The web app and API could not be reached for two hours. No measurement data have been lost.

**Preliminary Root Cause**:
An error by the cloud hoster Microsoft caused a global outage of many cloud services including the possibility of storing measurement data.  
See <https://www.zdnet.com/article/azure-global-outage-our-dns-update-mangled-domain-records-says-microsoft/>

**Mitigation:**:  
After two hours all services were working again and the pending measurement transmission automatically waited in a queue and were stored into the DB as soon as the outage was fixed.

**Next Steps**:  
None.
